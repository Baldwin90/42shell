WHERE TO START

read the header file. read the comments

then check the functions. they might not always have the same names
as prototypes because this was just copied from my 21sh

IMPORTANT

Does not use AST
Somehow gonna have to integrate

WHAT'S MISSING

get_fd is not yet fully complete. EASY

actual execution of the command including forking, calling builtins. INTERMEDIATE

parsing through the string starting ith "PATH=" in (char **)env. HARD

WHEN WILL IT BE DONE

will be done by dinner for sure
