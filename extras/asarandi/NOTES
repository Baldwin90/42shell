-changed builtin prototypes to return ints, so they can be used with logic operators

the convention is to return 0 on success or different code on failure;

-echo will always return 0, always success
-exit will not return? but will use sh->exit_code variable for exiting, or if argument given and argument is numeric it will use that as its exit code; for example "exit 123" will exit with code 123
-help builtin will always return 0, we need to change the help message to describe the shell and display builtin info
feature suggestion? maybe have help builtin describe each builtin separately, ie if user types "help cd" then display detailed information about cd and its options/functionality

-env builtin will always return 0, always successful because it only display environment variables and it does not fail
-setenv will return 0 if it succeeds, or 1 if variable name is not alphanumeric, also 1 if variable's first character is not alpha
 --setenv without parameters calls env() builtin (always returns 0)
-usetenv will return 0 if it succeeds, or 1 if given too few arguments, for ex "unsetenv" without a parameter will fail, return 1
